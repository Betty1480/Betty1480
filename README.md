## My Projects
Here are some of my favorite projects:

### [Career Landscape of Data Professionals: A Power BI Analysis]() [![View Project](https://believed-roadrunner-a2f.notion.site/TASK-2-POWER-BI-DASHBOARD-CREATION-5ebaa149cf6548468ca350250db2a308)](https://believed-roadrunner-a2f.notion.site/TASK-2-POWER-BI-DASHBOARD-CREATION-5ebaa149cf6548468ca350250db2a308) 
- **Description:** The Terrorism Database contains information about terrorist attacks worldwide. It includes
details such as the date, location, attack type, weapons used, number of casualties, and
responsible groups. Your task is to create a Power BI dashboard that provides a
comprehensive overview of global terrorism trends and patterns...
- **Technologies:** PowerBI .
- **Summary:**
  - The analysis indicates that bombings using explosives are the most common and effective methods used by terrorist groups, particularly in the Middle East and South Asia. Private citizens and property are the primary targets, and groups like the Taliban and Islamic State are major perpetrators. The success rates of terrorist attacks have shown significant variations over the years, with notable peaks in 2000 and 2020..

### [Database Design & Programming with SQL](https://github.com/Betty1480/Database-Design-Programming-with-SQL.git)
üìö Bookstore Database System ‚Äì MySQL Project
As part of a hands-on group project, I designed and implemented a fully functional MySQL database system for a fictional bookstore. The system efficiently manages structured data related to books, authors, customers, orders, and shipping.

Key contributions included:

Database Design: Modeled complex relationships using ER diagrams (Draw.io) and optimized table schemas.

SQL Development: Created multiple interrelated tables (e.g., book, author, cust_order, order_status) and implemented relationships using appropriate data types and constraints.

User Management: Configured user roles and permissions to enhance database security.

Data Querying: Executed queries to retrieve insights and test data integrity.

Tools Used: MySQL, Draw.io
Skills Gained: Relational DB design, SQL scripting, data normalization, user access control

üìç This project showcases my ability to create real-world data solutions using relational databases.

### [YOUTUBE STREAMER ANALYSIS](#)
- **Description:** YOUTUBE STREAMER ANALYSIS.
- **Technologies:** Python: Utilized Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
**KEY FINDINGS AND SUMMARY**
This document analyzes the top 1000 YouTube streamers' statistics from July 2018, using Python and various libraries for data manipulation and visualization. Key findings reveal that Entertainment, Gaming, and Lifestyle are the most popular categories among top streamers, and a positive correlation exists between the number of subscribers and the number of likes or comments. The report also discloses that audience preferences for content categories vary across different countries, and the average metrics for these top streamers include approximately 500,000 subscribers, 1,000,000 visits, and 50,000 likes.
